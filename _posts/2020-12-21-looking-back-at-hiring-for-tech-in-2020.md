Because many of my readers will be on vacation this week and the next, I want to keep these two editions light. I'll be back in January with the usual content.

This week, I want to reflect on 2020. I wrote my first edition of Hiring For Tech [back in February]({% post_url 2020-02-03-whats-wrong-with-tech-hiring %}) when COVID-19-related restrictions hadn't yet taken over the US. My goal was to look at each interview I conducted and find the gaps I knew were present in the hiring process. But within a month of launching the newsletter, I started working from home and the tech industry either stopped or slowed down hiring significantly.

Still, I've learned a great deal, so let's take a look back at the last 10+ months of writing:

- Many of the tech industry's inability to accommodate a diverse group of people have been highlighted this year. Whether it's the [sudden stresses of the pandemic]({% post_url 2020-05-25-letting-the-little-things-slide-remote-interview-edition %}) and the shift to remote work, or the push to [dismantle system imbalances]({% post_url 2020-06-01-speak-up %}), equitable hiring is more important than ever.

- People see the need for a better system, and they're speaking up. By setting out to write about tech hiring, I've found others who have published articles on the same subject, or [even done academic research]({% post_url 2020-08-03-reducing-interview-stress-with-independent-work %}). The conclusion is the same: the current interview process excludes talented people, and that needs to change.

- The same topics come up again and again in the discussions about tech hiring. Writing out my thoughts on a regular basis has given me a library of articles to reference whenever these conversations arise. My favorite moment was when a reader had some questions and thoughts about improving the hiring process, and I was able to link to past articles on each and every topic they brought up.


In next week's edition, I'll outline where I see tech hiring going in 2021, and how I plan to be a part of that future. Until then, happy holidays!
