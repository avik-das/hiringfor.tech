Last week, I talked about [what I've learned about tech hiring in 2020]({% post_url 2020-12-21-looking-back-at-hiring-for-tech-in-2020 %}). Again, because I expect lower than usual readership over the holidays, I'll keep today's edition light. Let's talk about where I think tech hiring is headed in 2021:

- The COVID-19 pandemic changed how we work, and as the world slowly comes back to some semblance of normalcy, the tech industry has the opportunity to rethink how it hires. The measures put in place to accommodate remote hiring and a stress-filled environment can continue paving the way to accommodate all types of people in the future. My optimism is somewhat tempered by the prospect of the pendulum swinging in the other direction as a reaction, causing companies to become more cut-throat as previously unemployed workers re-enter the job market.

- People have always been talking about hiring, but I see a lot of actionable advice floating around now. I've tried to compile other people's perspectives in this newsletter, as well as offer my own actionable advice. I'm hoping to see even more people speak out about what effective hiring looks like.

- Finally, putting these two points together, I'm looking to make a material impact in the future. Certainly, if I start a company or join a startup again, I'll use the advice from this newsletter to set up an equitable hiring process. But even within a big company, as hiring slowly opens up, I'm talking within my team to see what changes we can make going forward.

Tech hiring can get better in 2021, but only with deliberate effort. Without this effort, the setbacks we had this year will only get worse.

If you're interested in making a change in your company, but don't know how, reach out to me. I would love to help you implement the ideas in this newsletter in your organization.
